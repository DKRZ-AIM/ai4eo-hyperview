# AI4EO Hyperview

This repository contains the contribution of the team EagleEyes to the ![AI4EO Hyperview Machine Learning Challenge](https://platform.ai4eo.eu/seeing-beyond-the-visible)

**Overview**

The objective of the AI4EO HYPERVIEW challenge is to predict agriculturally relevant soil pa-
rameters (K, Mg, P2O5, pH) from airborne hyperspectral images. We present a hybrid model fusing
Random Forest and K-nearest neighbor regressors that exploit the average spectral reflectance, as
well as derived features such as gradients, wavelet coeï¬€icients, and Fourier transforms. The solution
is computationally lightweight and improves upon the challenge baseline by 21%.

**This Repository contains the following:**

* A jupyter notebook containing the final solution can be found in ![final-submission](final-submission).
* The folder ![notebooks](notebooks) contains some jupyter notebooks for data exploration and first simple models
* We explored several other approaches, which can be found in ![hyperview](hyperview)
    * Different Neural Network architectures (based on keras) ![NN keras](hyperview/keras])
    * ![PSELTAE model](https://github.com/VSainteuf/pytorch-psetae) (based on pytorch-lightning) ![PSELTAE](hyperview/pytorch_lightning) 
    * ![Random Forest and XGBoost models](random-forest)
